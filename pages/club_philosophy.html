				Southern ITF Taekwon-do was set up by Steve Weston in April 1997 to cater for the needs of ITF practitioners in Tasmania. The aims of the club are to promote the ideals of the International Taekwon-Do Federation as set out in the Charter of Taekwon-Do in General Choi’s Encyclopaedia of Taekwon-Do. Briefly these are:
				<ol>
					<li>Through the use of the scientific practice of Taekwon-Do one can improve one’s health and nourish the intellect. This should enable a student of taekwon-do to gain positions to assist others in the cause of justice, thereby promoting social ethics and morals, thus bringing about a happier and more peaceful society.</li>
					<li>To enlarge one’s spiritual realm by learning techniques of grace and power and thereby come to terms with all that life puts in front of a person.</li>
					<li>To not become avaricious, to remain humble and merciful and never to compromise one’s principles or be swayed by selfish motives and thereby ensure the independence of Taekwon-do and so that it can be passed on in a pure form.</li>
					<li>To demonstrate to the world that discrimination of any form is unacceptable and to ensure a sense of the essential equality of mankind is preserved.</li>
					<li>By dedicating oneself to Taekwon-do it is possible to promote a more moral society by demonstrating self discipline, sacrifice and devotion.</li>
					<li>By setting a good example in one’s behaviour it will influence others to follow that way of life.</li>
				</ol>
				So in promoting these ideals the club endeavours not only to teach the physical skills of Taekwon-do which are useful as a method of self defence but also to give guidance and set an example of how we can build a peaceful and happier world. The club should fundamentally be a place were anyone regardless of creed or race should feel a sense of welcome and belonging, it should be a friendly non-threatening environment where people learn to deal with difficult situations and strive to achieve the best they can.
				<br>&nbsp;<br>
				The instruction in the club should always be based on knowledge of the techniques of Taekwon-Do and be presented in a scientific manner so as to assist a student to learn as quickly and effectively as possible. Everyone should be encouraged to strive for the best they can achieve and so all instructors should be well trained in order to ensure a quality instructing team who support each other and share there knowledge freely with students.
				<br>&nbsp;<br>
				The club should promote the tenets of Taekwon-do i.e.: Courtesy, integrity, perseverance, self control and indomitable spirit.
				<br>&nbsp;<br>
				Fundamentally the club has been set up to allow people to come together to learn a quality martial art but also to be able to interact and enjoy the company of other people. Therefore the club encourages a sense of cooperation and recreation and actively promotes social interaction amongst its members. This allows an opportunity to become aware of the ideals and needs of each member and gives members the opportunity to expand their own viewpoints from the basis of informed debate. The club endeavours to assist members to achieve their full potential in life.

							<b>Interpretation of Do-San</b><br>
							Do-San is the pseudonym of the patriot Ahn Chang-Ho (1876-1938). The 24 movements represent his entire life (In the orient a persons life is measured as a day i.e. 24 hours so the twenty four moves represents a lifetime) that he devoted to furthering the education of Korea and it's independence movement. <br>

							The following is a detailed explanation of the training secrets. You should read and understand this although you are not expected to memorise it. You should be however be able to state the nine secrets as above. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>The first training secret</b><br>
							To study the theory of power completely <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>The second training secret</b><br>
							To understand the purpose and meaning of each movement clearly
							This statement would seem self evident to any good instructor but often the moves in patterns are merely shown to the students without any explanation of the purpose for the technique. Indeed it is only when the student really starts to analyse the techniques they are performing that they realise the value of their martial art. If a student doesn't understand what the technique is for then they will use it inappropriately and subsequently risk injury. This not only applies to blocks and strikes but also to the way in which stances are used. In particular in ITF Taekwon-Do, students should realise that a "dodge" involves not only moving sideways to avoid an attack but is a term used to describe a defensive movement in which the practitioner strikes at a target as they jump away from the target. Since ITF Taekwon-Do has 3200 techniques it is essential that whenever an instructor shows a new technique to their students that they explain how it should be utilised. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>The third training secret</b><br>
							To bring the movement of the eyes, hands, feet, and breath into a single coordinated action.
							In completing the movement of the hands and feet at the same time one will ensure that maximum power is derived from the technique because the movement will finish in a balanced position and will be structurally sound. The focusing of the eyes on ones opponent at the moment of contact ensures that the technique ends where it should; and the outwards breath tightens the muscles of the stomach, once again creating for that fraction of a second at impact, the structural soundness needed to transfer the power of the technique where required. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>The fourth training secret</b><br>
							To choose the appropriate attacking tool for each vital spot.
							It is this secret which allows anybody to use Taekwon-Do as an effective self defence martial art. If a student utilises the attacking tools that they are shown appropriately then the need for strength is to a large extent eliminated. So a student must know the vital spots on the body and then be able to determine what technique would be appropriate for the particular vital spot. If we consider for example the throat as a vital spot there are only a limited number of tools which can be used effectively at this target. One could of course use a punch, however if attacked to the throat most people tend to drop their chin, which diminishes the chance of a clear strike. Thus it is more appropriate to use a smaller tool such as a knife hand, reverse knife hand, long fist or finger pincers. Anyone who has felt even a gentle strike to the Adam's apple with any of these tools knows how little force is required to disable, thus illustrating the importance of knowing and using the appropriate tool for a target. This credo is used throughout the art with General Choi outlining in his 15 volume Encyclopaedia 30 pages of appropriate attacking tools to vital spots as well as appropriate blocking tools for specific attacks. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>The fifth training secret</b><br>
							To become familiar with the correct angle and distance for attack and defence.
							Of course it is easy to say one must use the appropriate attacking tool etc. but if these tools are not employed at the right distance and from the correct angle then they can be rendered totally useless. To return to the above example of a strike to the throat, it would be pointless to use a knife hand strike if you were three feet away and standing in front of your target, conversely to use a long finger strike from the side would be equally as ineffective. So emphasis in training is placed on making sure that when you strike that you can hit the appropriate target if you so choose, this is why step sparring and in particular three step sparring is so important in training. It teaches the students the correct angle and distance for attack and defence better than any other mechanism. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>The sixth training secret</b><br>
							Keep the arms and legs bent slightly when the movement is in motion.
							It is this secret that ensures the fluidity of movement which allows the practitioner to move easily and without stiffness. The dynamism of Taekwon-Do is renowned and is to some extent a consequence of this rule. It is important to point out that it states that the joints must remain bent whilst the motion is in movement not necessarily when the movement is complete. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>The seventh training secret</b><br>
							All movements must begin with a backwards or opposite movement with very few exceptions. However, once the movement is in motion it should not be stopped before reaching the target.
							The purpose of this secret is to ensure that the maximum momentum is achieved from every technique employed. In other words the full mass of the attacking or defending tool is used with maximal speed at the end of the motion. This is why it is important that the movement does not stop until impact with the object to which it is directed is achieved. A good example of an application of this secret is once again the knife hand strike. From a guarding block position the initial movement of the front hand is toward the body (ie. backwards) and not straight at the target, as it moves back it generates speed and then as the muscles of the body start to move forward with the strike the hand changes direction and gathers even greater speed until it reaches maximum velocity as it strikes the throat. Without the slight backwards movement at the beginning of the movement the momentum of the strike is severely limited and the outcome is a decrease in the power of the technique. This applies not only for hand techniques but also for foot techniques and the few exceptions where it does not apply are usually related to releases from holds or grabs. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>The eighth training secret</b><br>
							To create a sine wave during the movement by utilising the knee spring properly.<br>
							<center>
								<font style="font-size: 24pt; font-weight: bold;">~</font> Classical sine wave form
							</center>
							<br>
							A sine wave is a mathematical function which resembles the gentle waves that are seen in the sea. In order to move in this fashion the practitioner must initially bend the knees slightly thereby moving downwards and providing the necessary spring that allows the weight to be taken off the feet as the body rises to the middle of the movement, then once past the centre the body weight again drops at the completion of the movement. The purpose of this form of movement is twofold, the raising of the body through the centre point allows the practitioner to move rapidly and with little weight on the feet, and the dropping of the body weight at the end of the movement ensures that the maximum amount of mass possible is applied to the technique at the end of the movement, thereby increasing the momentum. To practitioners of most Karate styles this way of moving is considered to be incorrect, with most insisting on the head moving in a horizontal line and the use of a substantial hip twist in order to apply as much mass to the impact as possible. I can only speak from my own experience here, despite using and teaching the karate way for many years, I now use a sine wave because, firstly, I find it to be a more natural way of moving, secondly, I find it to be substantially less injurious to the lower back and most importantly I now generate more power in my techniques than when I used hip twist alone. The only down side I have encountered in using sine wave is when entering karate competitions the judges always take marks off because as one judge pointed out to me your "head has to stop bobbing up and down". It is important to note that this way of moving is generally only used in martial arts by ITF Taekwon-Do practitioners and was only developed relatively recently by General Choi Hong Hi. It is therefore not seen in many of the styles of Taekwon-Do which where part of the original ITF when it was formed in the 1960's. To General Choi's credit he is not content to let his martial art become stagnant and even at the age of 79 years he is still making improvements. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>The final training secret</b><br>
							To exhale briefly at the moment of each blow except in a connecting movement.
							As explained in training secret three and one the exhalation at the end of a movement ensure the muscles of the abdomen are taut at the moment of impact and therefore provide structural strength to the technique, however during a connecting movement this would slow down the second technique rendering it less effective, therefore only a single exhalation occurs at the end of the second technique in this case.

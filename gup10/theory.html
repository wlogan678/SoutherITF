							<b>Pronunciation:</b> TaeKwon-Do not TaiKwon-Do <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>Translation:</b> Translated literally, Taekwon-Do means <q>Art of Hand and Foot Fighting</q>. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							
							<b>Meaning of TaeKwon-Do</b><br>
							A way of life. Taekwon-Do is a version of unarmed combat designed for the purpose of self- defence. It is more than just that, however. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							It is the scientific use of the body in the method of self-defence: A body that has gained the ultimate use of its facilities though intensive physical and mental training. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							It is a martial art that has no equal in either power or technique. Though it is a martial art, it's discipline, techniques and mental training are the mortar for building a strong sense of justice, fortitude, humility and resolve. It is this mental conditioning that separates the true practitioner from the sensationalist content with mastering only the fighting aspects of the art. <br>

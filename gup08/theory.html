							<b>Meaning of Belt</b> <br>
							Yellow signifies Earth from which a plant sprouts and takes root as the Taekwon-Do foundation is being laid <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							
							<b>Meaning of high/middle/low vs. Section</b><br>
							When describing an attack or block in relation to the user one refers to high middle or low, when referring to a position on an opponent it is described in terms of the section of the body being attacked or blocked, i.e. high section, middle section or low section. <br>

							  <li>Breath control</li>
							  <li>Reaction Force</li>
							  <li>Equilibrium</li>
							  <li>Concentration</li>
							  <li>Speed and Mass</li>
							</ul><br>
							
							The following is a detailed explanation of the theory of power. You should read and understand this although you are not expected to memorise it. You should be however be able to state the 6 components of power as above. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							General Choi considered that their are six components which determine the power of a technique.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>The first of these is the use of breath control.</b> Controlled breathing not only affect's ones stamina and speed but can also condition the body to receive a blow and augment the power of a blow directed against an opponent. Any martial artist who has been practising their art for a substantive length of time will realise the value of exhaling sharply prior to a blow being landed against a pressure point. The act will to some extent stifle the pain and may prevent the loss of consciousness. Conversely the act of exhaling sharply at the moment of impact when delivering a blow tenses the abdominal muscles and therefore ensures structural stability through the body at the moment of impact. this ensures the full force of the blow is delivered to the opponent and is not dissipated through the performers body. Once a blow is delivered a slow inhalation helps in the preparation for the next movement. One breath should be used for each movement except for example where two moves are linked together to form one. It is important to remember not to inhale whilst focusing a block or blow against an opponent since this will not only impede movement but also result in a loss of power. One should also try to disguise any outward signs of fatigue since an experienced attacker will surely press home the advantage if they realise the opponent is on the point of exhaustion. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>The second component of power is Reaction force.</b> According to Newton&apos;s Law, every force has an equal and opposite force, therefore when an automobile crashes into' a wall with a force of x Newton’s the wall must return this force in order to remain standing, and when a downward force is applied to the end of a see-saw, an approximately equal upward force is applied on the other end. In the case of delivering of a blow to an opponent rushing towards you, when they are struck by your blow the force of impact is the addition of the two opposing forces. It is important that the time of impact be minimised so that the entire force of the impact is transmitted into the struck object as quickly as possible. This will ensure the maximum destructive effect. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>The third aspect which determines the power of a technique is equilibrium.</b> By this the general was referring to balance, which is of paramount consideration in Taekwon-Do. By ensuring the body is always well balanced a block or blow is more effective and deadly. Conversely, the unbalanced one is easily toppled. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>Concentration (the fourth component) in this instance has two meanings.</b> The first of these relates to the area upon which the force is applied. By concentrating the entire force over a very small area we will increase the power of the technique. This can be shown by reducing the size of the nozzle on a water hose. When the nozzle is a large opening the water will not spray far from the end of the hose however when the nozzle is constricted (thereby concentrating the force) the spray travels much further. The same principle applies when using an open hand technique versus a fist. The slapping action distributes the force over a larger surface area and diminishes the force on a spot. whereas by concentrating the entire force into the first two knuckles the spot force is more destructive. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The second meaning of concentration involves the mental concentration needed when performing techniques. This is an obviously essential component for any effective practitioner of any martial art. It involves awareness of not only ones own body dynamics but also the opponents position and movements. It is .important here for the practitioner to look not at the attackers hands and feet but instead to be aware of their upper body especially the head and shoulders, since this will tell them not only when they are about to move but also how. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>Speed (the fifth component) is an essential factor in the generation of power.</b> It is directly related to the power of the technique, ie. the faster the technique the more power generated. Without explaining the physics behind the principle in detail, it is sufficient to say that if the velocity (or speed) of the technique changes a lot in a very short space of time then the power will be very destructive such as when a board is smashed. If however the change in speed at the impacting moment take a relatively long time to occur (for example when kicking a large focus bag) then the impactive force is less. It should therefore be clear that in order to have powerful technique then the speed of the move should be fastest at the moment of impact and the force should be transmitted into the object over the least possible time. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>Mass or weight as it is less correctly known is also related to momentum and therefore force.</b> It is obvious that when a truck traveling at 50 kilometres per hour hits an object it does significantly more damage than a <q>Mini Minor</q> doing the same speed. It would not have escaped the attention of any student who has faced the largest student in the class that when this student struck them it generally hurt more than when the smallest student did, even though the big guy may be less agile. The general has therefore devised a mechanism which ensures that the maximum mass possible is applied to each technique. This is known as the sine wave technique and will be elaborated on in the training secrets.
